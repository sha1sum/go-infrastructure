# GO Infrastructure

GO Infrastructure is a collection of packages useful in building platforms. These
tools are open sourced in the hopes that gophers may find value; however, it is
not expected that these will become popular frameworks.

The design goal of these packages is to produce a set of related packages that
help simplify the development of robust platforms. Many of these ideas come from
working on platforms for enterprises such as Adobe, TimeWarner Cable, Dolby, PowerChord System, and more.

These packages may change often.

If you find these packages helpful share the love and let us know.
