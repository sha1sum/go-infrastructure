# GIA: GO Infrastructure

GIA: GO Infrastructure is a collection of packages useful in building platforms. These
tools are open sourced in the hopes that gophers may find value; however, it is
not expected that these will become popular frameworks.

The design goal of these packages is to produce a set of related packages that
help simplify the development of robust platforms. Many of these ideas come from
building, supporting, advising, and observing platforms for enterprises such
as [Adobe](http://adobe.com), [TimeWarner Cable](http://www.timewarnercable.com/),
[Dolby Labs](http://dolby.com), [Guardly](http://guardly.io/),
[InVision](http://invisionapp.com),
[PowerChord](http://powerchordsystem.com), and more.

These packages may change often and are currently in robust development.

If you find these packages helpful share the love and let us know.
